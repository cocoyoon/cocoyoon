I am a _blockchain research engineer_ dreaming Korean-version _Gavin Wood_. My interest fields are **Asynchronous Programming**, **Cryptography**, and **Web3 ecosystem**. What I want to achieve as a developer is to build what could be valuable to people. I organize my thoughts in terms on development on [HackMD](https://hackmd.io/@_4S152SHS_uXVYn0bwHKpQ) or share knowledge through [Medium](https://medium.com/@cocoyoon). Currently, my main language is **Rust** and develop blockchain node using **Substrate** framework. Check my [Portfolio](https://cocoyoonmind.notion.site/SoYounJeong-facf6f3a91744307978edd2545d5ce8a) to know more about me. Thank you.
